                    <p class="info">I am Chukwuma Nwaugha, a Product Engineer & Full stack Developer. Over the last 3yrs, I have gone from working with a Health Tech. company to a data and services company and, currently, to a ride-hailing company in Virginia USA. 

                    <br/><br/>I am up-to-date with current frontend, backend, and cloud technologies, and I have a keen understanding of key DevOps concepts such as CI/CD. 
                    <br /><br/>Fundamentally, I love supercharging day-to-day applications like Google Forms and Spreadsheets with Google Apps Script and Cloud Integrations.
                    <br /> <br />
                    Finally, I love to read books, go hiking & kayaking.
